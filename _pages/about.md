This blog is a collection of any potential election fraud or irregularities from the 2020 election. Examples of past elections would be great to have too as many Americans seem to doubt such things could exist. If you have any to add please submit a pull request on [github](https://github.com/youdecidetimes/stopthesteal/settings).

As it's impossible for me to personally verify all allegations I am giving the benefit of the doubt to accusers. If you have proof that the allegation is true or false please add any links or photo evidence to the post in question. If you are not comfortable with git and markdown please email me the info and I will update the page. youdecidetimes@protonmail.com

I will try to archive any links and upload videos to my rumble channel to avoid any future twitter censoring.

I'm working on this project anonymously because I work for one of the most liberal companies in the country and I highly doubt they'd approve. I'd prefer to keep my salary
